# ServerSeconds
A basic addon for World of Warcraft that calculates server seconds.
# WARNING
Server time differs, not counting hours, from user to user and can be off by more than a minute. This is likely done by Blizzard to minimize lag that would be created by sending every player a time update at the same time. This however makes Server time innefective as a variable to be used to share time sensitive-data between two users.
# Other
This code used to be part of my pull addon, SPull, but after I observed the odd time effects mentioned above I decided to seperate it and make this instead of completly destroying it. Prehaps I'll come back to this in the future and flush it out. I am also working on a way to synch the local time of users to be used in spull and plan to seperate that into a seperate library when it is completed.
# Using this code
